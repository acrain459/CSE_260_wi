Implement 128 bit aligned memory reads 
	Copy arrays into new buffers that are 128 bit aligned.  

Implement shared memory so that the GPU can split up the for loops and iterate over shared memory vs DRAM

Implement Blocking?  Copy on blocking so that the new memory is 128 bit aligned and fits into GPU caches and shared memory 

=================== ~115 Gflops ===============================

???  I'm open to ideas  
	Papers to read to take advantage of GPU optimizations
